## Multiplerblx (MultipleRoblox)
### PLEASE DO NOT SHARE YOUR REAL ROBLOX ACCOUNT TOKENS ONLY ALT ACCOUNT TOKENS SO THEN YOUR ACCOUNT HAS A LOWER CHANCE OF GETTING HACKED 
### WE DONT SAVE TOKENS/COOKIES BUT FOR YOUR SAFETY WE SHALL SAY THIS 

Multiplerblx is a tool designed to manage and launch multiple Roblox accounts simultaneously using account tokens. It allows users to load accounts, validate them, and join them into the same game using a specified Place ID.

### Why Was This Tool Created?

This tool was developed to facilitate the management of multiple Roblox accounts. A key future application involves logging in-game chat across these accounts. The collected chat data is intended for AI training and development, with user consent.

*   **Full release date:** August 5th, 2025
*   **Chat logging feature:** Planned for inclusion in the full release.
*   **Lua Injection Support:** This tool does not currently support, nor is it intended to support, Lua script injection into Roblox. Its focus is on account management and automation.

### What is Xeno?

Xeno is a third-party Roblox executor. Multiplerblx is an independent tool focused on account management and does not integrate with, rely on, or endorse Xeno or any similar executor tools for Lua script execution.

**Note:** The safety, reliability, and compliance with Roblox's Terms of Service of Xeno or any other third-party executor cannot be guaranteed. Use such tools at your own risk and discretion.

### Important Notes

*   Multiplerblx is intended for educational purposes and legitimate automation.
*   Users must ensure their use of this tool complies with Roblox's Terms of Service.
*   This project is under active development. Features and functionality are subject to change.
*   **Data Collection Notice:** Future versions may include opt-in features for collecting data (like chat logs) for AI analysis. Clear user consent will be required for such features.
