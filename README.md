# Multiplerblx (MultipleRoblox)
Multiplerblx is a tool designed to log into up to 10 Roblox accounts at once and join them into the same game using a specified gameId.

# Why Was This Tool Created?
This tool was made to log Roblox users' in-game chat across multiple accounts. The collected chat data will be used for AI training and development.

Full release date: August 5th, 2025

Chat logging will be included in the full release

This tool does not currently support Lua script injection

# No Lua Injection Support
Multiplerblx does not have any built-in functionality to inject Lua code into Roblox. This is due to the current development level and coding limitations. Script execution may be added in the future.

# What is Xeno?
Xeno is a Roblox executor trusted by many users. While Multiplerblx does not rely on Xeno, it can be used alongside it if Lua script execution is needed.

## Note: The safety and reliability of Xeno cannot be guaranteed. Use third-party tools at your own discretion.

# Notes
Multiplerblx is intended for educational and AI development use only

Use responsibly and in compliance with Roblox's terms of service
