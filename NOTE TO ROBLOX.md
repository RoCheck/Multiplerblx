## Note to Roblox

This tool, Multiplerblx, is designed for automation purposes involving Roblox account tokens. If Roblox or its representatives formally request that this tool cease its automation activities related to Roblox, the developers and contributors will comply. This includes removing the tool from public distribution and potentially making its core functionality available only in a non-automated, non-formatted text format as a form of archival or proof of prior creation, as was done with previous versions.

We aim to respect Roblox's Terms of Service and wishes regarding automation. This note serves as a commitment to de-escalate and comply if such a request is made officially.
